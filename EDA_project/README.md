## Data
Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an ambient air pollutant for which there is strong evidence that it is harmful to human health. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with setting national ambient air quality standards for fine PM and for tracking the emissions of this pollutant into the atmosphere. Approximatly every 3 years, the EPA releases its database on emissions of PM2.5. This database is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI).

For each year and for each type of PM source, the NEI records how many tons of PM2.5 were emitted from that source over the course of the entire year. The data  used herein are provided by the NEI for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

The code in this repo visualizes the data to determine:
* How total emissions from PM2.5 have changed in the United States from 1999 to 2008;
* How total emissions from PM2.5 have changed in Baltimore City, Maryland from 1999 to 2008;
* How PM2.5 emissions from the four given sources have changed in Baltimore City from 1999 to 2008;
* How PM2.5 emissions from coal combustion-related sources in the United States changed from 1999 to 2008;
* How PM2.5 emissions from motor vehicle sources changed in Baltimore City from 1999 to 2008;
* How PM2.5 emissions from motor vehicle sources were different from 1999 to 2008 in Baltimore City and Los Angeles County
